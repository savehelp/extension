# extension
this extension puts a content script into every page it can (doesn't work on sandboxed pages or in a few select textboxes). 
these content scripts sends the keys you press while holding ctrl to the background script 
which then does the correct action. Specifically, if you type for example, Ctrl+1+2 it will 
bring you to the 12th tab from the left and if you type Ctrl+-+2 it will bring you to the 2nd tab 
from the right. I wanted this functionality of going to tabs past the 9th tab and indexing from the right, so
I made it in this extension.
